# Chat Detective | Microsoft Hackathon 2025

![Chat Detective UI](assets/Chat-Detective-Banner.png)

> Mission Statement  
Empower investigative and intelligence teams to rapidly identify risks, threats, and key actors hidden within large volumes of chat dataâ€”while preserving privacy, ensuring auditability, and enabling responsible, defensible AIâ€‘driven decisions.

## 1. What Is This Project?

Chat Detective is an agentic AI application built during **[Microsoft Hackathon 2025](https://innovationstudio.microsoft.com/hackathons/hackathon2025/project/100453)**.  
It ingests raw chat transcripts in bulk (e.g., messaging platforms, exported logs, case evidence) and helps analysts:

- Surface entities (people, locations, orgs, handles, aliases)
- Identify risky behaviours (threats, coercion, fraud indicators, extremism signals)
- Summarise long multi-party threads
- Highlight temporal patterns & escalation
- Produce exportable, auditâ€‘friendly reports

Designed for airâ€‘gapped or controlled environments, Chat Detective emphasises security, transparency, and modular deployment.

## 2. About Microsoft Hackathon 2025

The Microsoft global hackathon is an annual internal innovation event where teams prototype bold ideas across AI, productivity, sustainability, trust, and more.  
This project targets the intersection of:

- Trustworthy AI in sensitive intelligence workflows  
- Augmented analytical decisionâ€‘making  
- Secure, compliant AI orchestration patterns

## 3. Why Chat Detective?

| Challenge | Existing Pain | How Chat Detective Helps |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Volume overload | Thousands of chat messages per case | Summarisation + semantic clustering |
| Hidden risk signals | Manual keyword scanning | Pattern & intent detection |
| Disconnected context | Identities & aliases fragmented | Entity linking & timeline views |
| Compliance pressure | Outputs hard to justify | Transparent reasoning & audit artefacts |
| Deployment constraints | Cloudâ€‘only tooling | Deployable onâ€‘prem / VNet / containerised |

---

## 4. Core Features (Current & Planned)

### Delivered (Hackathon Scope)
- Multi-file transcript ingestion
- Entity extraction & categorisation
- Threat phrase / intent detection (rule + model hybrid)
- Conversation summarisation (threadâ€‘level + global)
- Analyst notes + export (basic)
- Role-based UI scaffolding (placeholder roles)

### In Progress / Roadmap
- Confidence scoring & explainability panels
- Timeline heat map (frequency & intensity)
- Sourceâ€‘linked evidence cards
- Model policy enforcement (PII redaction modes)
- Offline / airâ€‘gapped model runner
- Chainâ€‘ofâ€‘custody log export (JSON + PDF)
- Multilingual support (language detection + translation pass)

## 8. Ethical Use & Responsible AI

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Necessity | Only process caseâ€‘relevant transcripts |
| Explainability | Provide traceable evidence for flagged items |
| Privacy | PII minimisation & optional redaction layers |
| Accountability | Audit log for each analytic operation |
| Bias Mitigation | Periodic sampling & evaluation sets (planned) |

If you identify risks (false positives, bias surfaces), please open an issue labelled `responsible-ai`.

## 10. Limitations (Current)
- Prototype reliability (not productionâ€‘certified)
- Limited multilingual accuracy
- Entity disambiguation heuristic only (no knowledge graph yet)
- No full SOC/IR workflow integrations yet

---

## 11. FAQ (Seed)
| Question | Answer (Draft) |
|----------|----------------|
| Does this train on my data? | No, inference only (adjust if architecture differs). |
| Can it run fully offline? | Planned roadmap feature. |
| Is output admissible in court? | Designed for traceability, but requires legal review. |
